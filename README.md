StellarWall is a lightweight and customizable live wallpaper engine for Windows that allows you to set animated GIFs and MP4 videos as your desktop background. Personalize your workspace with dynamic playlists that change based on time intervals, the time of day, or even the day of the week.

## âœ¨ Features

*   **Animated Backgrounds:** Supports both **GIF** and **MP4** video files.
*   **Dynamic Playlists:**
    *   **Interval Mode:** Cycle through a folder of wallpapers or a custom list at your chosen time interval (minutes or hours). Supports manual order, sequential playback (with initial shuffle), or fully random selection.
    *   **Time of Day Mode:** Automatically switch wallpapers to match the mood of the morning, afternoon, evening, and night.
    *   **Day of Week Mode:** Curate unique wallpaper playlists for each day of the week.
*   **Background Audio:** Enhance your live wallpaper with an accompanying MP3 audio track.
*   **Performance Optimization:**
    *   **Low Spec PC Mode:** Option to limit MP4 video playback to 1080p or lower to conserve resources.
    *   **Focus-Aware Pausing:** Automatically pauses visuals (and optionally audio) when the desktop is not active, saving system resources.
    *   **Aggressive GPU Reduction:** Optionally hides wallpaper content entirely when the desktop loses focus for maximum GPU savings (may cause a slight flicker on focus change).
    *   **Configurable Preview Quality:** Choose between smooth (higher quality) or fast (lower resource) video preview generation in the UI.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Easily select files, manage playlists, and configure settings through an intuitive tabbed interface.
*   **System Tray Integration:** Runs conveniently in the system tray with quick access to:
    *   Show/Hide the main application window.
    *   Pause/Resume the entire engine.
    *   Quickly play recent wallpapers.
    *   Quit the application.
